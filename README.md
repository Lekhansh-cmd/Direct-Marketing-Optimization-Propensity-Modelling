# Direct Marketing Optimization

# Direct Marketing Optimization with Data Science

## Task
The objective of this project is to maximize revenue from direct marketing campaigns using dummy data. The key tasks involved include creating analytical datasets, developing propensity models, and optimizing targeting clients with direct marketing offers.

## Data
The analysis utilizes several tables containing social-demographical data, product ownership details, transactional data, and actual sales revenues. The training dataset includes actual sales and revenues for 60% of clients, while the remaining 40% constitute the targeting set.

## Proposed Steps
1. **Create Analytical Dataset**: Merge and preprocess various data tables to create training and targeting datasets.
2. **Develop Propensity Models**: Build three propensity models for predicting consumer loan, credit card, and mutual fund purchases using the training dataset.
3. **Optimize Targeting**: Identify clients with higher propensities for each offer and optimize targeting to maximize revenue.

## Expected Result
The project aims to answer the following questions:
- Which clients have higher propensity to buy consumer loan, credit card, or mutual fund?
- Which clients should be targeted with each offer?
- What would be the expected revenue based on the targeting strategy?

## Executive Summary
This report provides insights into the analysis conducted for direct marketing optimization. It covers the objective, technology used, analysis steps, model evaluation, revenue prediction, and expected results. The key findings include the accuracy of propensity models, identification of targeted clients, and expected revenues from marketing offers.

### Technology Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

### Analysis Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Merge, preprocess, and handle missing values.
2. **Propensity Model Development**: Develop models for consumer loan, credit card, and mutual fund purchases.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using training and testing datasets.
4. **Revenue Prediction and Targeting**: Calculate propensity scores and predict revenue for each marketing offer.
5. **Results**: Analyze accuracy scores, RMSE, and expected revenues for targeted clients.
